# DOCsubgroup_mtngradient
DOC Subgroup for the Mountain Gradient Conceptual Paper

We want to construct a null model the describes DOC (input?) to lakes along an elevation gradient. Based on first principles we can look at the fundamental relationships between elevation and temperature/precipitation and how this controls vegetation, soil depth and ultimately DOC. 

Temperature and Precipitation will both affect soil depth/carbon

Runoff will influence transport to lakes, runoff will vary with elevation bc of veg cover.
Q to group, are these our first principles? Is there something else we should consider?

The assumptions are that everything else is held constant, e.g. CALA, lake area, depth, catchment area, vegetation type,  evaporation(?), etc. and these are some variables we can play with in a model.
