# DOCsubgroup_mtngradient
We want to construct a null model the describes DOC (input?) to lakes along an elevation gradient. Based on first principles we can look at the fundamental relationships between elevation and temperature/precipitation and how this controls vegetation, soil carbon turnover, and temperature controls on DOC leaching.

Primary Drivers 
Decrease in Temperature 
Increase in Precipitation

Decreasing temperatures will influence DOC concentrations to receiving lake water bodies through a number of factors. 

1) temperature will determine vegetation composition. We will create a model to describe a change in vegetation from forest, shrub, grass, lichen to barerock. Along with these vegetation types, there are well documented carbon input rates and densities to soils. This gradient will result in a decrease in carbon inputs with elevation

2) temperature will determine the residence time of carbon in soils. As temperature cool, the rate declines and more carbon accumulates. Trumbore 1996 et al (Science) have developed an equation to describe this relationship (Carbon inventory weighted turnover time = 138exp[0.11*T] ). This relationship creates an increase in soil carbon stocks with elevation until the reduced carbon inputs of lichen and bare rock result in a strong decline. 

3) Because temperature influences the turnover rate it also influences the amount of labile carbon available for transport to lake ecosystems. This relationship creates a decrease in the flux of DOC with decreasing temperature, and upslope. 

The landscape or lake mosaic factors to consider are
Catchment Area, Lake Area, and the CALA
Lake Depth
Evaporation
Snow and seasonality
